# My dotfiles

## what's in it
Not much. But after cloning it will not work right out of the box. Many things need to be copied from one place to another. Also, there are dependencies that might need to be installed. I will use symlink to link all of the files in one place soon.

## thanks

A lot of stuff were inspired from others' dotfiles and here are a few I remember:

* [ze-best-zsh-config](https://github.com/spicycode/ze-best-zsh-config)
* [Anachron's i3blocks scripts](https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks)
* [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
* [xero's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
* [l3pp4rd's dotfiles](https://github.com/l3pp4rd/dotfiles)
* [alexbooker's dotfiles](https://github.com/alexbooker/dotfiles)

Also, [dotshare.it](dotshare.it) is a great place for finding nice configurations.
